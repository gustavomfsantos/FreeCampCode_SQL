About the projects:

Project 1: Build a Database containing information about the Universe. The task involved creating table for Galaxies, Stars, Planets and Moons.

register the customer if is a new customer and also set an appointment for the service scheduled.

Project 4: Using nano and git commands, besides SQL and terminal bash already applied knowledge in previous projects, build a Database with some periodic table's elements
